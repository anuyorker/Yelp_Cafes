# Can we use Yelp reviews to generate tips for restaurants? 

## Motivation
Yelp currently has “tips” from users to help other users 
But reviews also hold valuable information for businesses!

## Project Goals
* Look specifically at cafes: Yelp’s “Coffee & Tea” category
* Discover topics relevant to a particular cafes based on its reviews
  * Analyze relationship between…
    * topics and star-ratings
    * topics and reviewer sentiment
  * Create a model to predict topics of unseen reviews
    * Generate feedback based on topic stars and sentiments
